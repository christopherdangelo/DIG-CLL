# DIG-CLL 

## About the Project
This is a private GitHub repository for microbiome analaysis
To be added - description of mouse, methods, etc, if desired

Kate To Do:
- as of May 17 we are not planning on trimming the reads - kate triple check the literature
- PDF for the kit itself does have adapter sequences - look on the shared drive
- Form a methods justification for not trimming reads but also report back on concerns: Sequences are high quality
- Can always re run if needed 
- Look at the lit on the shared drive to see what other advanced analyses we could try
