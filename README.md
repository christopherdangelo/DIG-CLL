# DIG-CLL 

## About the Project
This is a private GitHub repository for microbiome analaysis
To be added - description of mouse, methods, etc, if desired

Kate To Do:
- Triple check the literature and form a methods justification for not trimming reads but also report back on concerns
- Look at the lit on the shared drive to see what other advanced analyses we could try
- ASH Abstracts due August 2, early July as a target for some results to possibly include 
  - focus on adoptive transfer possibly for this
